Robust multi-channel onset detection for percussive audio.

ghostnote makes sense of relationships between recordings of the same audio
across multiple sensors/microphones, and uses this to identify the location of
the origin of the sound - in the example of a drumkit, we use a combination of
overhead and close microphones to locate where the drum is hit, in real-time.

This information can be used to map locations to actions - effectively
creating, in the drumset example, an electric kit alongside the acoustic drums.
Or controlling an FX rig, lightning, or whatever you want!

Check [[file:notebooks/intro.org][intro.org]] for a detailed introduction into the topic and links to what is
currently being worked on.

ghostnote is in active development and not yet easily usable.
